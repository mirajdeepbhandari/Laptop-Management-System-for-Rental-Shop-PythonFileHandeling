# Laptop Management System for Rental Shop (Buying ,Selling, Generating Invoices and Updating Stock of Laptops) File Handling Project In Python

The project aims to develop a program that will assist a laptop rental shop in managing
its inventory and transactions. The program will enable the shop to read a text file
containing information about available laptops and update the file according to the
transactions that occur. The transactions include ordering laptops from manufacturers
and selling laptops to customers. The program will also generate notes or invoices for
each transaction, including details such as the name of the laptop, brand,
customer/distributor, date and time of purchase, and total cost.

The program will have the ability to update the inventory text file with real-time
information, reflecting the current stock of each laptop. It will also be able to handle
different types of transactions, generating appropriate notes or invoices for each one.
The text file will contain columns with information such as the name of the laptop, brand,
price, quantity available, processor details, and graphics card details. The program will
automatically update the quantity available of each laptop after every transaction.
For each sale, the note or invoice generated by the program will contain details such as
the name of the laptop, brand, customer, date and time of purchase, total amount
without shipping costs, shipping cost, and total amount to be paid, including the
shipping cost. When laptops are ordered from manufacturers, the note or invoice should
include the name of the distributor, name of the laptop, brand, date and time of
purchase, net amount, VAT amount, and gross amount.

The program will be a useful tool for the laptop rental shop to manage its inventory and
keep track of transactions. It will also save time by automatically generating notes or
invoices for each transaction. The program will enable the shop to have accurate and
up-to-date information about the inventory, which will be useful for forecasting and
decision-making. The ease of use of the program will be helpful for the shop's
employees and will minimize errors. Overall, the program will make it easier for the
laptop rental shop to manage its business and provide quality service to its customers.
